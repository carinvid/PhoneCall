# PhoneCall
create a C++ program using Visual Studio where you design a “PhoneCall” class that holds a phone number to which a call is placed, the length of the call in minutes, and the rate charged per minute. Overload extraction and insertion operators for the class. In this program, overload the == operator to compare two PhoneCalls. Consider one PhoneCall to be equal to another if both calls are placed to the same number. Also, create a main() function that allows you to enter ten PhoneCalls into an array. If a PhoneCall has already been placed to a number, do not allow a second PhoneCall to the same number
